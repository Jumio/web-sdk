# Jumio WebSDK

Jumio WebSDK is a powerful, flexible software development kit that simplifies the integration of Jumio's services into your web applications.

## üì¶ Installation

Great news! The Jumio WebSDK doesn't require any additional dependencies to be installed. It is specifically designed to work out of the box, streamlining your development process and enhancing efficiency.

## üöÄ Usage

To get started, edit the `index.html` file located within the root directory of this project and set the `dc` and `token` attributes of the `jumio-sdk` element.

* Set `dc` (datacenter) with one of the available values:
    * `eu` for Europe
    * `us` for United States
    * `sgp` for Singapore
* Set `token` with your unique Jumio authentication token.

Remember, correctly setting up these attributes is crucial for your instance of the Jumio WebSDK to run properly.

Once the above configuration is done, serve the \`index.html\` file. The easiest way to do this is by using the [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package. To use it, execute the command below and follow the instructions displayed on the screen.

```
npx serve
```

*Please note that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be installed on your machine to run this command. If not installed, download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).*
